# Parametric Design of a Building
![](Animation.gif)
This is a sample app demonstrates the use of parametric design to build a simple buildin, see an animation of the VIKTOR app above.

Using this app you can parametrically generate a building structure. For each generated building structure, the environmental impact is shown as the Shadow Cost over the lifecycle of the building structure.

# App structure 
This is an tree app.
